### **What is CI/CD ?**

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment. It is a method used in software development to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. 

The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.   
Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment.  

Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline" and are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile way with either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach. 

CI/CD automates much or all of the manual human intervention traditionally needed to get new code from a commit into production, encompassing the build, test (including integration tests, unit tests, and regression tests), and deploy phases, as well as infrastructure provisioning.   

By automating integration and delivery, CI/CD lets software development teams focus on meeting business requirements while ensuring code quality and software security. CI/CD is an essential part of DevOps and any modern software development practice.

CI Pipeline:
- Build
- Code Quality
- Tests
- Packages

CD Pipeline:
- Review/Test
- Staging
- Production
