### Here are few Git and GitLab interview questions and answers:

1. What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

2. What is GitLab?
GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitLab?
Git is a version control system, while GitLab is a **web-based Git repository manager** that provides additional features such as continuous integration and continuous deployment.

4. What is a repository in Git?  
A repository in Git is a collection of files and folders that are managed by Git.

5. What is a branch in Git?  
A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on a feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.
 
6. What is a merge in Git?  
A merge in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another branch.

7. What is a pull request in Git, and how it is different from 'git pull' command ?  
A pull request in Git is a request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another branch or fork. It is a way for developers to collaborate on a project and review each other's changes before they are merged into the main codebase.  
When a developer creates a pull request, they are essentially asking the project maintainers to review their changes and merge them into the main codebase. The pull request includes a summary of the changes made, as well as any relevant comments or questions.  
Once a pull request is created, other developers can review the changes and provide feedback or suggestions. The project maintainers can also review the changes and decide whether to accept or reject the pull request.
If the pull request is accepted, the changes are merged into the main codebase. If the pull request is rejected, the changes are not merged, and the developer can make additional changes and submit a new pull request.  
On the other hand, git pull is a Git command used to retrieve and download content from a remote repository and update the local repository as soon as it has been downloaded. The git pull command is used to fetch and merge code changes from the remote repository to the local repository. It is a combination of two commands, git fetch followed by git merge. In the first stage, git fetch is executed that downloads content from the required remote repository. Then, the git merge command combines multiple sequences of commits into a single branch.

1. Give step-by-step overview of how a pull request works?  
   1. Create a new branch: Start by creating a new branch in your Git repository that contains the changes you want to propose. Typically, this branch is based on the target branch you wish to merge your changes into.
   2. Commit and push your changes: Make the necessary changes to your files, commit them to your branch, and push the branch to the remote repository. These changes will be included in the pull request.
   3. Open a pull request: On the repository hosting platform, such as GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket, navigate to the repository and find the option to create a new pull request. Select the source branch (the branch with your changes) and the target branch (the branch you want to merge into).
   4. Provide details and context: In the pull request form, provide a title and a detailed description explaining the changes you made, why they are necessary, and any other relevant information. This helps reviewers understand the purpose and scope of your changes.
   5. Request reviews: Assign reviewers to the pull request. Reviewers are typically other developers who will examine your code, provide feedback, and ensure the proposed changes meet the project's standards.
   6. Review and discussion: Reviewers will examine the changes, leave comments, suggest modifications, and engage in a discussion with the pull request author. This feedback loop allows for collaboration and refinement of the proposed changes.
   7. Make further commits and updates: Based on the feedback received, you may need to make additional commits or updates to your branch. These updates are automatically reflected in the pull request.
   8. Address feedback and iterate: Respond to the comments and suggestions provided by the reviewers, make the necessary modifications, and continue the iterative process until the changes are considered satisfactory.
   9. Merge the pull request: Once the reviewers and the author are satisfied with the changes, and any required checks (such as automated tests) have passed, the pull request can be merged into the target branch. This incorporates the proposed changes into the project.
   10. Close the pull request: After the pull request is successfully merged, it can be closed. The pull request history and discussions are preserved, providing a record of the changes made and the review process.   <br> <br>      
  
1. What is a commit in Git?  
A commit in Git is a snapshot of the changes made to a repository at a specific point in time.
 
1. What is a tag in Git?  
A tag in Git is a way to mark a specific commit as important or significant.

1.  What is a fork in GitLab?  
A fork in GitLab is a copy of a repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

1.  What is a merge request in GitLab?    
A merge request in GitLab is a request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another branch or fork.

1.  What is a pipeline in GitLab?  
A pipeline in GitLab is a set of jobs that are run in a specific order to **build, test, and deploy code**.

1.  What is a runner in GitLab?  
A runner in GitLab is a tool that runs jobs in a pipeline.

1.  What is a webhook in GitLab?  
A webhook in GitLab is a way to trigger a pipeline or other action in response to an event, such as a push to a repository.

1.  What is a protected branch in GitLab?  
A protected branch in GitLab is a branch that is protected from accidental or unauthorized changes.

1.  What is a Git hook?  
A Git hook is a script that is run automatically by Git in response to certain events, such as a commit or a push.

1.  What is a stash in Git?  
A stash in Git is a way to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed.

1.  What is a submodule in Git?  
A submodule in Git is a way to include one Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.

1.  What is rebasing in Git?   
Rebasing in Git is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit.

1.  What is cherry-picking in Git?  
Cherry-picking in Git is the process of applying a specific commit from one branch to another branch.
To cherry-pick a commit in Git, follow these steps:  
    1. Identify the commit you want to cherry-pick. You can find the commit hash by using the `git log` command.
    2. Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commit. You can use the `git checkout` command to switch to the branch.
    3. Use the `git cherry-pick` command followed by the commit hash to apply the commit to the current branch. For example, `git cherry-pick abc123`.
    4. Resolve any conflicts that arise during the cherry-pick process. If there are conflicts, Git will pause the cherry-pick process and prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually.
    5. Once the cherry-pick is complete, commit the changes to the current branch using the git commit command.<br><br>
